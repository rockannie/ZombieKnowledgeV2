Instructions for how to play: 

Use arrow keys or WASD to move the knight. Your health bar is the top bar and the knowledge/brain bar is the bottom one. Collect zombie friends by feeding them brain (press G), or attack them (press F) before they attack you. To recharge your brains, stand in front of the 'library' door aka the door that you spawn in front of. The goal is to get as many zombie friends as possible before dying.
